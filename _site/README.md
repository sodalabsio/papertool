# PaperTool

PaperTool is a customizable tool from [Monash SoDa Labs](https://www.monash.edu/business/research/our-research/soda-labs) for any standard Working Paper Series that handles:

- Automatically adding Department or Lab specific front cover template(s),
- Previewing the final paper,
- Uploading working papers to a central repository on AWS
- Updating previous working papers, and
- Archiving papers on [RePEc](http://repec.org/)

It's a fully cloud-based solution to one of the most common problems plaguing academics: Dissemination of working papers with minimal hassle and cost. Setup your working papers site within minutes!

**See an example**: Check out the [Monash SoDa Labs working paper series](https://ideas.repec.org/s/ajr/sodwps.html) at RePeC, and be sure to inspect a PDF of any working paper.

> We offer PaperTool both as a DIY open source tool for anyone to setup a working paper series on their own and also as a paid service from SoDa Labs. Please feel free to reach us at *SoDaLabs@monash.edu* should you require this service.
